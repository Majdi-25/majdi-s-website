  <h2>About (summary)...</h2>
  <h3>Majdi</h3>
  <p>I was born to South African parents, in Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe), on the 11th of November. At the request of my 
    grand-mother, I was named “Ian Douglas”, after the Rhodesian prime minister (Ian Douglas Smith), because I was born, on Rhodesia's 
    national day. The change from white minority government (Rhodesia) to black majority government (Zimbabwe), resulted in challenges 
    and abuses for me. At some point in 2000, Mum decided I stop using the name Ian and use the Muslim name Majdi (the name given to me, 
    by my father). Because of the troubles I experienced in Zimbabwe, I applied for and got South African citizenship by decent. In 
    October 2006, I applied for permanent residence in Zimbabwe and instead (without my having any plans in place), was told, I was “a 
    foreigner interfering in Zimbabwe's internal affairs therefore, had till morning to be out of the country or face arrest”. At the end 
    of 2023, I took voluntary retrenchment and moved to Cape Town. Things did not go according to plan. The struggles I faced, exposed me 
    to the shortcomings of both social networks and politicians.</p>

  <p>With this in mind, my mission is not only to re-invent myself but, create two organisations (MajdiAid and UbuntuPath), with simple 
    objectives - UPLIFTING, PROTECTING AND UNITNG, EVERY SOUTH AFRICAN.</p>

  <h3>MajdiAid</h3>
  <p>The name Majdi, is of Arabic origin and loosely translated means, Noble/Honorable. The name Majdi, therefore perfectly aligns with the 
    two core values of the platform. <br> 
    1. Addressing the individual and community holistically (physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and financially), with NOBLE intent. <br> 
    2. Ensuring every interaction brings HONOR, to the individual and community.</p>
    
  <p>Therefore, the mission at MajdiAid is to uplift individuals communities by making a real and permanent impact, by building a charitable 
    (pay-it-forward) network/community dedicated to inspiring, supporting and uplifting those around us, holistically. MajdiAid therefore 
    welcomes individuals, communities, businesses, NGO's, governmental and political agencies, to work with us directly or by forming 
    partnerships.</p>

  <h3>UbuntuPath</h3>
  <p>The South African political landscape is saturated, with politicians and political groups that serve as nothing more than, lobby groups - 
    groups dedicated to the interests of a particular demographic, rather than serving SOUTH AFRICA and ALL HER PEOPLE. The result is, South 
    Africa is a divided and dying nation with no national goals or chance of success. At UbuntuPath, although we believe race, religion and 
    culture (our diversity) add to the beauty of this great nation, THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE IS SIMPLY BEING, SOUTH AFRICAN.</p>
    
  <p>Our DUTY at UbuntuPath therefore, is to REPRESENT, PROTECT, UPLIFT, AND UNITE EVERY SOUTH AFRICAN - WITHOUT PENALTY, PREJUDICE OR FAVOUR.</p>
