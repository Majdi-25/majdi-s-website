    <h2>About</h2><p>I was born in Rhodesia and had politics thrust on me. With the change to Zimbabwe at 11 years old until age 38, I faced politically based abuses. In 2006, I was forced to leave Zimbabwe for Polokawne, South Africa without departure plans. Visits to Zimbabwe, always resulted in politically related abuses there. In 2023, I left a comfortable life in Polokwane, in search of opportunities in Cape Town. These did not materialise. Now stuck in Cape Town unemployed and broke with a 15 year old daughter, I've decided to make a better future for myself and others in my situaton.</p></h2>
