  <h3>UbuntuPath</h3>
  <p>UbuntuPath, is the brain child of ID Williams (Majdi), who was born to South African parents, in Zimbabwe. After relocating to Cape Town 
    (Western Cape) from Polokwane (Limpopo),  Majdi was exposed to the flaws and exclusion of the political and financial systems, crime and 
    poverty. The UbuntuPath, therefore aims to highlight, challenge and correct the status of all injustices.</p>

  <p>South Africa is not a mistake of history; it is a miracle of courage. We are a nation born from ancient soil and modern struggle, forged 
    by pain yet sustained by hope. From the first peoples who read the land like scripture, to those who crossed oceans and borders seeking a 
    future, this land became home to many – and therefore, belongs to all. UbuntuPath begins here: not with division, but with unity and 
    dignity.</p>

  <p>Our strength has always been our diversity. Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, Swazi, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa, Zulu, Coloured, Asian and white, 
    each thread adds colour to the fabric. Ubuntu teaches us: a person is a person through others. This is not a slogan; it is a national 
    instruction.</p>

  <p>We sing an anthem that weaves languages together, not as rivals, but as a chorus and the song, ‘Afrikaans landgenote’ powerfully goes 
    something to the effect – “unity, freedom, justice and love. All of us together, in our land.”</p>

  <p>Yet pride must not blind us to the truth. The South African political landscape is saturated, with politicians and political groups that 
    serve as nothing more than, lobby groups - dedicated to the interests of a particular demographic, rather than serving SOUTH AFRICA and 
    ALL HER PEOPLE. After decades of freedom, corruption and state collapse have stolen our future. Politicians failed to speak to the soul 
    of the majority and to unite the nation, beyond class and race. South Africa’s political parties have fragmented hope, for narrow gain. 
    The result is, South Africa is a divided and dying nation with no national goals or chance of success.</p>

  <p>At UbuntuPath, although we believe race, religion and culture (our diversity) add to the beauty of this great nation, THE MOST IMPORTANT 
    ATTRIBUTE IS SIMPLY BEING, SOUTH AFRICAN. UbuntuPath therefore calls for a new ethic: competence with compassion, growth with justice, 
    unity with accountability. We honour our past, but we refuse to be trapped by it. We choose a future where every South African, rises 
    together. South Africa, this is an invitation to…</p>

  <p>1.Remember who we are, to celebrate every contribution, and to change our politics - together. <br> 
    2.REPRESENT, PROTECT, UPLIFT, AND UNITE EVERY SOUTH AFRICAN - WITHOUT PENALTY, PREJUDICE OR FAVOUR.</p>
