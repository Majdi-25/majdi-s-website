  <h2>About Majdi...</h2>
  <p>At my grandmother's insistence, I was named ‘Ian Douglas’ after the Rhodesian prime minister (Ian Douglas Smith), because I was born on the 11th of November, Rhodesia's national day. The change from white minority government (Rhodesia) to black majority government (Zimbabwe), resulted in challenges and abuses, for me. At some point in 2000, Mum decided I stop using the name Ian and use Majdi (the name given to me by my father). Eventually, after years of difficulty and abuse (extortion, threats on my person, freedom and life, actual arrest and three attempts on my life), I applied for and got South African citizenship, by decent. In 2006, I applied for permanent residence in Zimbabwe and instead (without my having any plans in place), was told...</p>
  <p>I was interfering in Zimbabwe's internal affairs therefore, had till morning to be out of the country or face arrest. </p>
  <p>On my entry, a South African official at Beitbridge Border looked at me then at my passport, smiled and said, "WELCOME HOME". For the twenty six years of Zimbabwe's existence I was told, I did not belong, I was not Zimbabwean and now, on my first ever interaction with South Africans on South African soil, I was being welcomed "HOME".</p>
  <p>I arrived in Polokwane and after a two year struggle, found my feet. Some time later, I faced a legal battle emanating from Zimbabwe. Thereafter and on 'legal advice' on the South African side, travel to Zimbabwe was stopped. The uncertainty of the 2020 covid lockdown, had me seek financial advice and I voluntarily went on debt review. At the end of 2023, I took voluntary retrenchment and moved to Cape Town.</p>
  <p>In Cape Town, things did not go according to plan. Although I was now an unemployed, broke, 54 year old single parent on debt review (debt management plan), I was able to pay my debt for about a year, without issue. Thereafter, things got financially worse and I sought help/assistance and got none. I experienced first-hand, the failures of government, the limitations of existing NGO's/NPC's and social systems. At the same time, I saw the growing negative social impact of these and decided to act.</p>
  <p>With this in mind, I decided to walk a different path, not only by re-inventing myself but, by creating two organisations (MajdiAid and UbuntuPath), with simple objectives – uplifting, protecting and uniting every South African.</p>
